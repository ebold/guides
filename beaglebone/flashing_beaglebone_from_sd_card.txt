Flashing Beaglebone Black board with Debian 9.9 (Strech LXQT)

Prerequisites:
- Linux PC (USB port, SD card slot)
- SW tools (minicom, xz, wget, dd)
- Beaglebone Black board, serial-to-USB cable (TTL-232R-3V3)
- SD card (with at least 4GB capacity)

1. Download SD image file with Debian 9.9 (Strech LXQT) [1].

$ wget https://debian.beagleboard.org/images/bone-debian-9.9-lxqt-armhf-2019-08-03-4gb.img.xz
sha256sum: ff4af8aa309b7842de0759cf1f732c09a80b4ade1e89157a442f1bf93a359318

2. Unzip downloaded image, write the extracted image to the SD card.

$ xz -dk bone-debian-9.9-lxqt-armhf-2019-08-03-4gb.img.xz
$ dd if=bone-debian-9.9-lxqt-armhf-2019-08-03-4gb.img.xz of=/dev/mmcblk0 status=progress

3. Connect serial-to-USB cable to PC's USB port and start minicom. Turn off the hardware flow control (Ctrl+a -> o -> f -> Esc -> Exit).

$ sudo minicom -D /dev/ttyUSB0

4. Put the SD card into the BBB board and power on the board. If Debian boots successfully, then log in and then power off the board.
5. Eject the SD card and put it into PC again.
6. Mount the SD card and modify its boot environment to allow flashing on-board eMMC:
uncomment the line containing "init-eMMC-flasher-v3.sh" in the "/boot/uEnv.txt" file [2].

6. Put the SD card into the BBB board. Power on the BBB board by holding down the S2 button.
Once all 4 LEDs light up the "cylon" pattern (back and forth) then release the button. When flashing is completed, then 4 LEDs will be off (or on).

7. Remove the SD card from the card slot and restart the board. Now the BBB board should boot Debian from its eMMC memory.
