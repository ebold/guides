# Transfer images from Linux to Android while preserving dates

## Environment:
- host with **Ubuntu 20.04**
- smartphone with **Android 10**
- Android app **Total Commander** with **SFTP plugin**

## Problem:
Android device is connected to PC host with __USB cable__ and image transfer is done with the __PTP protocol__.
But direct copy/move of image files from PC converts all the __creation__ dates to the __current__ date.

## Solution:
Total Commander with the SFTP plugin can allow you to copy images from Linux to Android without loosing original creation date.
