1. python: not found or command not found

On Ubunt 20.04 clonned a python project, but it was failed and returned:

$ make all
make: python: Command not found
make: *** [Makefile:2: all] Error 127

Asking the installed python version returns:

$ which python       # no output
$ python --version
Python 3.8.10

The reason is that the python project is only compatible with Python 2.x.

A simple solution might be a symlink to existing Python 3.8.

$ sudo ln -s /usr/bin/python3 /usr/bin/python
$ ll /usr/bin/python*
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root      16 Nov  5 15:50 /usr/bin/python -> /usr/bin/python3*
$ which python
/usr/bin/python

2. FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'dot'

When calling write_svg() method of the pydot module returns above error, Graphviz package might be missing on your system.

$ sudo apt install graphviz
