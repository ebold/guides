Best practices to optimize SSD under Linux (Mint 20.2, Ubuntu 20.04.x) [1]

1. Select the AHCI mode (BIOS/UEFI)

An SSD is usually recognized properly, when in the BIOS/UEFI the feature AHCI has been activated for the SATA interface.

2. Update firmware

Check the manufacturer's website for an update. The update is usually shipped as an iso file, so it doesn't matter that you're running Linux.

3. Select EXT4 for filesystem

The EXT4 is assumed to be the best filesystem for an SSD. The write activity caused by journaling in EXT4 is not very much compared to the BTRFS filesystem.

4. Avoid quick wear by reducing write actions

An SSD is worn down by write actions.
Steps given below help to keep wear down to a reasonable minimum, by limiting the write actions.

4.1. Set the daily TRIM job

For the good permorfance of SSD the cleaning action TRIM is usually recommended.
Note: old SSDs before 2010 usually don't support TRIM.

Automatic weekly TRIM is enabled by default in Linux Mint and Ubuntu, when they are installed on an SSD.
To change it to daily interval, invoke following commands:

$ sudo mkdir -v /etc/systemd/system/fstrim.timer.d # create new folder
$ sudo touch /etc/systemd/system/fstrim.timer.d/override.conf # create new file

Now edit new file with your favourite editor and add/modify following settings:

[Timer]
OnCalendar=
OnCalendar=daily

Note: double entries for "OnCalendar" is intentional!

Confirm the configuration by invoking a following command:

$ systemctl cat fstrim.timer

An output below is expected:

# /lib/systemd/system/fstrim.timer
[Unit]
Description=Discard unused blocks once a week
Documentation=man:fstrim
ConditionVirtualization=!container

[Timer]
OnCalendar=weekly
AccuracySec=1h
Persistent=true

[Install]
WantedBy=timers.target

# /etc/systemd/system/fstrim.timer.d/override.conf
[Timer]
OnCalendar=
OnCalendar=daily

The activity of fstrim can be checked by invoking:

$ journalctl | grep fstrim.service

If you need to undo and revert to a weekly TRIM, just remove the overriding settings:

$ sudo rm -v /etc/systemd/system/fstrim.timer.d/override.conf

Or you can execute TRIM manually:

$ sudo fstrim -av # it could take some minutes, simply wait patiently

or 

$ sudo fstrim -v / # in case if -av doesn't work

4.2. Limit swap wear

In Linux swappiness determines when to start using swap. It scales 0-100, and the default is 60.
For SSDs, the default of 60 causes too many write activities.
The optimal compromise is probably 20.

Commands given below help you to set/modify the swappiness:

$ cat /proc/sys/vm/swappiness # check current settings
$ sudo nano /etc/sysctl.conf  # open settings file and add "vm.swappiness=20" at the very end

Reboot is needed that the change is getting effective.

4.3. Limit disk write actions of Firefox

By putting the Firefox cache into the RAM and disabling sessionstore you can limit its disk write actions.
Note: repeat hacks in each user account.

4.3.1. Put the network cache into RAM

Note: don't do this when your computer has less than 2 GB of RAM!

Proceed like these:

> about:config                # type it in the URL bar of Firefox
> browser.cache.disk.enable   # type it into filter/search bar and toggle its value to "false"
> browser.cache.memory.enable # type it into filter/search and check its value, this should be set to "true"
> browser.cache.memory.capacity # -1 means automatic settings, so set it to eg 524288 KB (512 MB) or 1048576 (1 GB)

Restart Firefox and check its cache usage:

> about:cache

4.3.2. Lower sessionstore interval

The session restore feature remembers what pages were opened if Firefox experiences crashes. This feature is nice, but causes many disk writes for an SSD.

> about:config                # type it in the URL bar of Firefox
> browser.sessionstore.interval # 15000 (15 sec) is default, eg. increase it to 900000 (15 minutes)

Restart Firefox.

4.4. Limit disk write actions of Chrome

Disable "preload" feature that causes a lot of extra network traffic and writes.

> Settings -> Privacy and security -> Cookies and site data -> Preload pages faster browsing and searching: disable it

Note: proceed it also for each user account.
