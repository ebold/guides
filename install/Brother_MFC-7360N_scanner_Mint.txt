These instructions are tested with the Brother MFC 7360 multifunction device
on Linux Mint 18.3, Ubuntu 18.04 (bionic).

1. Easy way (works for most cases)

1.1. Download the driver installation tool: ie, linux-brprinter-installer-2.2.2-2.gz
1.2. Extract the downloaded zip file: gunzip linux-brprinter-installer-2.2.2-2.gz
1.3. Run the tool: sudo bash linux-brprinter-installer-2.2.2-2 MFC-7360N
1.4. Follow installation steps: answer 'y' to questions
1.4.1. When you see the message "Will you specify the DeviceURI ?", then enter 'y' (for network printer) and choose device URI number (ie., IP address)

2. If easy way fails, then try this way

It describes how to:
- install the drivers and tools required for the device,
- set up and use the chosen device as a network scanner

2.1. Download the drivers and tools for the chosen device (Brother Support web site)

- brscan4-0.4.4-3.amd64.deb
- brscan-skey-0.2.4-1.amd64.deb

2.2. Install the drivers and tools (use 'sudo' if required)

dpkg -i --force-all <scanner_drivers>  # install drivers listed above
dpkg -l | grep Brother                 # check installation

2.3. Set up a scanner device to be accessed over network

brsaneconfig4 -a name=<dev_name> model=<model> ip=<x.x.x.x> # add a scanner device accessible over network
brsaneconfig4 -d                       # diagnose network scanner

e.g.,

brsaneconfig4 -a name=myscanner model=MFC-7360N ip=192.168.100.100

2.4. Using the scanner device

With the brscan-skey tool one can scan directly from the scanner device. Prior
to that brscan-skey must be already launched.

brscan-skey        # launch the tool
brscan-skey -l     # check if the tool detect your scanner device
