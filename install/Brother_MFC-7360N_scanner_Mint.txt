These instructions are tested with the Brother MFC 7360N multifunction device
on Linux Mint 18.3/19.3/20.3/21, Ubuntu 18.04 (bionic) und 20.04 (focal).

1. Use an installation tool to install the LPR driver, CUPS wrapper, scanner driver and utility

The installation tool, linux-brprinter-installer-<version>.gz, will install following packages:
- LPR driver:      mfc7360nlpr-<driver_version>.i386.deb
- CUPS wrapper:    cupswrapperMFC7360N-<wrapper_version>.i386.deb
- scanner driver:  brscan4-<driver_version>.amd64.deb
- S-KEY utility:   brscan-key-<utility_verison>.amd64.deb

The latest version of the installation tool was '2.2.3-1' at the time of writing this guide.

1.1. Download the installation tool

1.1.1. Visit the Brother support web site: https://support.brother.com/
1.1.2. Click on 'Downloads' category and search for the 'MFC-7360N' device.
1.1.3. Choose 'Linux' and 'Linux (deb)' as OS and its version, click on 'OK' to continue.
1.1.4. Under 'Utilities' click on 'Driver Install Tool' (i.e. version 2.2.3-1). The EULA agreement must be accepted to continue.
1.1.5. The tool will be downloaded into your default download directory (i.e. $HOME/Downloads)

1.2. Extract the installation tool

1.2.1. Open a terminal window and change to the directory that contains the downloaded tool.
1.2.2. Extract the downloaded tool by invoking a command given below:
    $ gunzip linux-brprinter-installer-<version>.gz

1.3. Install drivers and utility by launching the installation tool

1.3.1. With superuser authorization launch the tool by specifing the device model:
    $ sudo bash linux-brprinter-installer-<version> MFC-7360N

1.3.2. Follow installation steps and answer 'y' to questions
1.3.3. When you see the message "Will you specify the DeviceURI ?", then enter 'y' (for network printer) and choose device URI number (ie., IP address). After specifying the IP address, the printer device gets accessable from network (set up by the installation tool):
    lpadmin -p MFC7360N -v socket://<IP address> -E
1.3.4. Istallation is completed by setting the scanner device accessable from network  (set up by the installation tool):
    brsaneconfig4 -a name=MFC-7360N model=MFC-7360N ip=<IP address>

2. Configuration for the S-KEY scanner utility

Installation of the S-KEY tool is optional, it allows you to use the Brother scanner device with its scanner buttons. An adequate guide is provided in https://wiki.ubuntuusers.de/Scanner/Brother/Scankey-Tool/

2.1. Optimize the S-KEY scanner utility

It's recommended to optimize scanner S-KEY utility by editing its configuration file: '/opt/brother/scanner/brscan-skey/script/scantofile-<script_version>.sh'

2.1.1. Resolution

Change the default resolution to 300 dpi.

2.1.2. Output file name

Change the output file name so that it prexifed with 'brscan_<date>-<time>':
    output_file=~/brscan/brscan_"$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)"

2.1.3. File format

The PDF is common file format for scanning and storing documents. To set this option an external tool, 'pnmtops', from the netpbm package will be used. The package can be installed with apt:
    $ sudo apt install netpbm

To choose PDF as file format update a line with 'scanimage' as follows:
    scanimage --device-name $1 --resolution 300 -l 0 -t 0 -x 210.00 -y 295.00 \
    | pnmtops -imagewidth 8.26 -nocenter | gs -q -dNOPAUSE -sDEVICE=pdfwrite \
    -sOutputFile=- - > "$output_file".pdf

where, $1 is scanner device.

A working example of scantofile script is attached in https://github.com/ebold/scripts/scantofile.sh

3. Use the scanner device

With the brscan-skey tool one can scan directly from the scanner device. Prior to that brscan-skey must be already launched.

$ brscan-skey        # launch the S-KEY utility in background
$ brscan-skey -l     # check if the tool detect your scanner device

The output looks like below:
 MFC-7360N  : brother4:net1;dev0 : <IP address> Active

If no device is presented, then stopping (brscan-skey -t) and repeat searching (brscan-skey -l) could help.

4. Usefull commands

4.1. Verify installed drivers and tools:
    $ dpkg -l | grep Brother   # you should see the drivers and tool listed in Section 1.
4.2. Diagnose network scanner:
    $ brsaneconfig4 -d
4.3. (optional, already set up by the installation tool) Set up the scanner device to be accessed from network:
    $ brsaneconfig4 -a name=<dev_name> model=<model> ip=<x.x.x.x>
