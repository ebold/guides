These instructions are tested with the Brother MFC 7360 multifunction device
on Linux Mint 18.3.

It describes how to:
- install the drivers and tools required for the device,
- set up and use the chosen device as a network scanner

1. Download the drivers and tools for the chosen device (Brother Support web site)

- brscan4-0.4.4-3.amd64.deb
- brscan-skey-0.2.4-1.amd64.deb

2. Install the drivers and tools (use 'sudo' if required)

dpkg -i --force-all <scanner_drivers>  # install drivers listed above
dpkg -l | grep Brother                 # check installation

3. Set up a scanner device to be accessed over network

brsaneconfig4 -a name=<dev_name> model=<model> ip=<x.x.x.x> # add a scanner device accessible over network
brsaneconfig4 -d                       # diagnose network scanner

e.g.,

brsaneconfig4 -a name=myscanner model=MFC-7360N ip=192.168.100.100

4. Using the scanner device

With the brscan-skey tool one can scan directly from the scanner device. Prior
to that brscan-skey must be already launched.

brscan-skey        # launch the tool
brscan-skey -l     # check if the tool detect your scanner device
